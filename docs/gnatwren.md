# Using Gnatwren

Homefarm has support for a lightweight monitoring service (also
written by myself) named Gnatwren. If you'd like to use it, it's very
simple to get going.

- Check out the [Gnatwren
  README](https://github.com/firepear/gnatwren) and follow the Docker
  install instructions to stand up an instance of `gwgather` (the data
  collection and reporting portion of Gnatwren)
