# Checking farm status

The program `boinctui` is installed on the control node, and its
configuration is kept in sync with the farm by the `update-projects`
playbook.

Run it anytime you'd like to see what the machines in your farm are
doing.

It can also be used for ad-hoc management of individual compute nodes,
and the workunits being handled by those nodes.
