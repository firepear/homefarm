# homefarm
Tools for deploying and managing a BOINC compute farm using Ansible, Raspbian, and Alpine Linux.

Homefarm makes a few assumptions:

* You have a Raspberry Pi, to act as the control node.
* You have one or more machines capable of running Alpine Linux, to act as the compute nodes.
* All nodes are on a private network, because an SSH key with no passphrase will be autogenerated for Ansible's use.

# Setting up your farm

## Control node setup

1. Image an SD card with [Raspbian
   Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), boot the
   Pi, and do any initial network/locale/etc configuration that you
   wish (recommended: enable the ssh daemon via
   `raspi-config`). Reboot if necessary.
1. Login as the default user and run `'sudo apt-get --yes install git'`
1. Run `'git clone https://github.com/firepear/homefarm.git'`
1. Run `'cd homefarm'`
1. Run `'sudo ./control-setup'`. The Pi will reboot after this
   script completes.
1. Login after reboot and edit `farm.cfg`, which is our Ansible
   inventory. Change `node00` in the `[control]` stanza to match the
   name you've given the controller (AKA your Raspberry Pi). Then add
   the names of all the machines you'll be setting up as compute nodes
   to the `[compute]` stanza.
1. Make sure the names and IP addresses of these machines are in your
   controller's `/etc/hosts` file.

The controller is now ready.
