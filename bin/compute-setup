# somewhere in here we need to get the contents of gui_rpc_auth.cfg
# shipped to the control machine, so it can be included in
# ~/.boinctui.cfg

# write playbooks that use boinccmd to attach to projects if we don't
# detect that we already are. which projects to connect to are based
# on vars in the playbook.

# other playbooks to do management, like suspend, resume, no new work,
# allow work? seems reasonable.
